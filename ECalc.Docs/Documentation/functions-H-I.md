HarmonicMean(Set)
```

In mathematics, the harmonic mean (sometimes called the subcontrary mean) is one of several kinds of average, and in particular one of the Pythagorean means. Typically, it is appropriate for situations when the average of rates is desired. The harmonic mean can be expressed as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals.

This function can be used on Sets.

Intersect(set1, set2)
```

Returns the intersection of two sets in a new set. In mathematics, the intersection A âˆ© B of two sets A and B is the set that contains all elements of A that also belong to B (or equivalently, all elements of B that also belong to A), but no other elements.
