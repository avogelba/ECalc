```
Sec(value)
```

Calculates the secant of an angle, which is the reciprocal of cos; i.e. the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent side.

```
Sech(value)
```

Calculates the hyperbolic secant of an angle.

```
Set(number1, number2, number3, ... , numberN)
```

Creates a set of numbers that can be used by set operations


```
Sin(value)
```

Calculates the sine of an angle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. (The word comes from the Latin sinus for gulf or bay, since, given a unit circle, it is the side of the triangle on which the angle opens.) 

```
Sinh(value)
```

Calculates the hyperbolic sine of an angle.

```
Sqrt(number)
```

Calculates the square root of a number. 

```
Square(number)
```

Raises the input number to the 2nd power, in other words calculates number * number.

```
StandardDeviation(set)
```

n statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma Ïƒ or s) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.

This funtion can only be used on sets.
