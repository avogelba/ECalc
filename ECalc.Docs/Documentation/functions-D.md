Deg2Grad(angle)
```

Converts an angle specified in degrees to gradians. The gradian is a unit of measurement of an angle, equivalent to 1/400 of a turn.

```
Deg2Rad(angle)
```

Converts an angle specified in degrees to radians. The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (when the arc length is equal to the radius). The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an SI derived unit.

Det(matrix)
```

Calculates the determinant of a matrix. In linear algebra, the determinant is a useful value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix.
