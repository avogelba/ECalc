```
Tan(value)
```

Calculates the tangent of an angle, which is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side: so called because it can be represented as a line segment tangent to the circle, that is the line that touches the circle, from Latin linea tangens or touching line (cf. tangere, to touch).

```
Tanh(value)
```

Calculates the hyperbolic tangent of an angle.

```
Transpose(matrix)
```

Returns the transposed matrix of the input matrix. The transpose of a matrix A is another matrix AT created by any one of the following equivalent actions:

* reflect A over its main diagonal (which runs from top-left to bottom-right) to obtain AT

* write the rows of A as the columns of AT

* write the columns of A as the rows of AT

Formally, the i th row, j th column element of AT is the j th row, i th column element of A
