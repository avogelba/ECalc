##Angle systems

The calculator support various trigonometrical functions. The return value of these functions is based on the selected trigonometrical mode. The supported systems by the calculator:

* **Deg**  
A degree is a measurement of plane angle, representing 1⁄360 of a full rotation 
* **Rad**  
The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle.
* **Grad**  
The gradian is a unit of plane angle, equivalent to 1⁄400 of a turn.

The calculator also contains angle system conversion functions. The output of these functions is not affected by the current angle system. The conversion functions:

```
Rad2Deg(rad) - Converts radians to degrees
Deg2Rad(deg) - Converts radians to degrees
Deg2Grad(deg) - Converts degrees to gradians
Grad2Deg(grad) - Converts gradians to degrees
Grad2Rad(grad) - Converts gradians to radians
Rad2Grad(rad) - Converts radians to gradians
```

##Number systems

The calculator supports various number systems as an input methood for numbers. The following systems are supported:

* **Decimal**  
Standard number system. Floating point numbers are only supported in this input system.
* **Octal**  
Base-8 number system, uses the digits 0 to 7. To use this format you must start the number with the #O characters. Example:
* **Hexadecimal**  
Base-16 number system, uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letters A to F. To use this format you must start the number with the #H characters.
* **Roman**  
Roman numerals, the numeric system used in ancient Rome, employs combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet to signify values. To use this format you must start the number with the #R characters.
