LCM(number1, number2)
```

Returns he least common multiple of two numbers. In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple (also called the lowest common multiple or smallest common multiple) of two integers a and b, usually denoted by LCM(a, b), is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b

Load()
```

Loads a TXT files contents to a new Set. The TXT file must contain numbers in each row. If the format is not supported or some other reading error occures, then an empty set is returned.

```
Log(number, base)
```

Returns the lograrithm of a number. In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse operation to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which another fixed value, the base, must be raised to produce that number.

```
Log10(number)
```

Returns the base 10 logarithm of a number

```
LogGamma(number)
```
Because the gamma and factorial functions grow so rapidly for moderately large arguments, many computing environments include a function that returns the natural logarithm of the gamma function. This grows much more slowly, and for combinatorial calculations allows adding and subtracting logs instead of multiplying and dividing very large values.

```
Loge(number)
```

Returns the base e logarithm of a number
