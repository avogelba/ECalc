Cos(value)
```

Calculates the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. (The word comes from the Latin sinus for gulf or bay,[1] since, given a unit circle, it is the side of the triangle on which the angle opens.)

```
Cosec(value)
```

Calculates the cosecant of an angle, which is the reciprocal of sin(A); i.e. the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the opposite side; so called because it is the secant of the complementary or co-angle.

```
Cosech(value)
```

Calculates the hyperbolic cosecant of an angle.
  
```
Cosh(value)
```

Calculatrs the hyperbolic cosine of an angle. 

```  
CplxConjugate(value)
```
Calculates the complex conjugate of a complex number, which is the number with equal real part and imaginary part equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. For example, the complex conjugate of 3 + 4i is 3 âˆ’ 4i.


```
CplxPolar(abs, angle)
```
Creates a complex number using the polar coordinate system. The first parameter is the absolute value, the second parameter is the angle.

```
CplxRi(real, imaginary)
```

Creates a complex number. The first parameter specifies the real part, the second specifies the imaginary part
 
``` 
Ctg(value)
```

Calculates the cotangent of an agnle, which is the reciprocal of tan(value); i.e. the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the opposite side; so called because it is the tangent of the complementary or co-angle.

```
Ctgh(value)
```
Calculates the hyperbolic cotangent of an angle.
