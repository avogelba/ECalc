```
Vect2D(x, y)
```

Creates a two dimensional vector that point from 0,0 to the specified coordinates.

```
Vect3D(x, y, z)
```

Creates a three dimensional vector that point from 0,0,0 to the specified coordinates.

```
Wavelength(frequency)
```

Calculates the wavelength from frequency. The wavelength of a sinusoidal wave is the spatial period of the wave - the distance over which the wave's shape repeats, and the inverse of the spatial frequency. It is usually determined by considering the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase, such as crests, troughs, or zero crossings and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves, as well as other spatial wave patterns. Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (Î»). The concept can also be applied to periodic waves of non-sinusoidal shape.

```
XL(inductivity, frequency)
```

Calculates the complex AC resistance of an inductor at a given frequency.

```
XC(capacity, frequency)
```

Calculates the complex AC resistance of a capacitor at a given frequency.
